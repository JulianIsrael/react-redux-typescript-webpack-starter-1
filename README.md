# react-redux-typescript-webpack-starter

This is a general purpose template that can serve as a starter kit for an app or a library. The source code is splitted to two folders `app` and `lib`. In case of a library, `app` folder serves as a showcase. If it's a regular app, then `lib` folder can be used as a placeholder for common components that will be later refactored to their package. Otherwise, it can be removed.

# WARNING: 

While this is work in progress and the starter is far away (well, may be not that far) from the major release, you can start using it to see how you can develop, test, and distribute TypeScript libraries. I have a long-term plan for this template and committed to keeping it up to date. PRs are welcome.
