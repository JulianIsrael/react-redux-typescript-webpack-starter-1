# react-redux-typescript-webpack-starter

This is a general purpose template that can serve as a starter kit for an app or a library. The source code is splitted to two folders `app` and `lib`. In case of a library, `app` folder serves as a showcase. If it's a regular app, then `lib` folder can be used as a placeholder for common components that will be later refactored to their package. Otherwise, it can be removed.
